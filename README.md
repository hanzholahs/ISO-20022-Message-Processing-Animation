# ISO 20022 Message Processing Animation

This application simulates the processing of ISO 20022 financial messages in a simple scenario involving 3 parties (2 Financial Institutions e.g. Banks, and Payment and Clearing Systems e.g. RTGS System). The app is developed to aid non-IT people understanding what information in ISO 20022 messages represent and how the messages are processed.

The app is written in Python and able to parse ISO 20022 XML Schema for pacs8 message (customer credit transfer). More information on ISO 20022 Financial Message can be accessed in the [official website](https://www.iso20022.org/).
